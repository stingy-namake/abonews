## To Do

The following features are planned to complete the CRUD functionality, improve my experience, and expand the platform's capabilities.

### 1. Core CRUD Completion & Views
- [ ] **Update Posts (CRUD - Update):** Implement the `edit` view and `update` controller logic to allow authenticated users to modify existing posts.
- [ ] **Delete Posts (CRUD - Delete):** Implement the functionality to delete a post with appropriate security checks.
- [ ] **Show Post Details:** Create a dedicated single post view (`post.show`) to display the full content, image, and post details (e.g., author, timestamp).

### 2. Permissions and Access Control
- [ ] **Public Read Access:** Configure middleware to allow unauthenticated users (guests) to view the post index and post details.
- [ ] **Auth Protected Actions:** Ensure that **Create, Edit, and Delete** actions remain restricted only to authenticated users (e.g., administrator roles).

### 3. Social & User Features
- [ ] **Comments System:** Implement a dedicated `Comment` model and relationship to allow users (and potentially guests) to leave comments on posts.
- [ ] **User Avatars:** Integrate a method (e.g., local storage, S3, or a service like Gravatar) to allow users to add or display profile avatars.
